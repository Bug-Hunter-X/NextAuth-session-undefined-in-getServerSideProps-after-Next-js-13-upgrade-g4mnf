# NextAuth Session Undefined in getServerSideProps after Next.js 13 Upgrade

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered after upgrading a Next.js application to version 13 while using NextAuth.js for authentication.  The `session` object in `getServerSideProps` is consistently undefined, leading to unexpected behavior in components relying on authentication status.

## Issue Description

After upgrading to Next.js 13, the `getServerSideProps` function in the `/pages/about.js` file receives an undefined `session` object, even when the user is logged in. This prevents conditional rendering based on the authentication status, resulting in incorrect UI display.

The code was working correctly before the Next.js 13 upgrade.  The issue appears to be related to incompatibility between NextAuth.js and the new architecture of Next.js 13.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Attempt to access the `/about` route.
5. Observe that the session status is always displayed as 'Not logged in', even if the user is authenticated.

## Solution

The solution involves updating the `getServerSideProps` function to correctly handle session retrieval within the new Next.js 13 context.  Refer to the `aboutSolution.js` file for a corrected implementation.
